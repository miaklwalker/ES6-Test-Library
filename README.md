# JavaScript Test Library

## Goals
 My goal for this project was to create a easy to use testing library for fellow vanilla JavaScript web developers.
In order to accomplish this I set out to do several things.
* Remove any need for any external libraries or packages e.g. Babel
* Remove the headache of setting up a entire testing environment.
* Keep the syntax readable and inline with current testing libraries.

## Usage

Using this library does "require" a few steps , but "require" isn't one of them.
